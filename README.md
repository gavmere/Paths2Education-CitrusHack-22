# Paths2Education-CitrusHack-22

Hi! Our names are Rushil Shah, Gavin Meregillano, Andrew Pham, and Ahaan Rajnekar. We all are freshman attending UC Riverside studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, respectively. 

We built a website that provides students with opportunties and scholarships. The website also aims to spread awareness on alternatives to college, which includes trade schools, entreprenuership, military, community college, and a gap year. Our project falls under the diversity and inclusion track for CitrusHack. 

Feel free to explore our website! Reach out if you have any questions or suggestions (rshah090@ucr.edu).

Thanks :)
